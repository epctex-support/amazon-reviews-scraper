## Input
When you want to scrape over the reviews from a specific URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the *startUrls*.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of the reviews list then put the link for the page and have the *endPage* as 1.

With the last approach that is explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the *endPage* parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

```json
{
    "startUrls":[
        "https://www.amazon.com/Clorox-30966-Concentrated-Regular-Bleach/dp/B07HXTYS1W/ref=sr_1_3?crid=ZT0PLQMYO4WP&keywords=clorox&qid=1702901115&sprefix=cl%2Caps%2C278&sr=8-3",

### Compute Unit Consumption
The actor is optimized to run blazing fast and scrape as many items as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all the detailed requests. If the actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 listings in 2 minutes with ~0.02-0.04 compute units.

## During the Run
During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified. When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

### Amazon Export
During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any language (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Amazon Reviews actor.
